# commute-status
Simple Android app to show the status of the next 4 trains for my commute.

Stations are configurable in the drop down menu, users can set the CRS station code for their Home and Work stations.

Station selections are then stored in shared preferences so that the user does not have to configure the app every time.

Using National Rail Enquiries Darwin API to provide the train times and statues.
